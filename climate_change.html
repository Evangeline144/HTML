<h1>What is Climate Change?</h1>
<p>Climate change can be defined as "Global Warming". Global warming in technical terms is the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. This is the cause of excess greenhouse gases being released to the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>What are greenhouses gases and how are they contributing to global warming?</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the Earth atmosphere. The help to keep the Earth's surface warm and distributes the heat trapped to other regions of the Earth's atmosphere. However, due to human activities, more and more greenhouse gases are being released into the atmosphere every minute. In fact, when you are breathing, you are also releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere</p>
<p>Some examples of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon dioxide gas</li>
<li>Nitrogen oxide<li>
<li>Sulfur dioxide<li>
<li>Carbon monoxide<li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide also reacts with water to form acid rain which will corrode our buildings and has a high acidity. Carbon monoxide is a grey gas that is emmitted from vehicles.</p>
<p>I know some of you might be thinking that what does climate change got to do with me? Well, climate change, first of all, does not show favouritism. Hence, no matter where you are, you will still be affected by the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>These are some effects of Climate Change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melting of polar ice caps</li>
<li>Rising sea levels</li>
<li>Increase in temperature</li>
<li>Extreme weather conditions</li>
<li>Loss of habitats</li>
<li>Loss of land</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list is just keeps going.</p>
<p>In Singapore alone, the government has already announced that the temperature has already risen from an average of 27 degrees Celsius in the 1960s to a shocking 34 degress Celsius, recording the highest temperature in 2015. However, this could also be seen in our sea levels that has risen at least 1m compared to the 1970s. This is due to the rising temperatures that led to the melting of polar ice caps. This is not the end. Scientists has expected the sea-level to rise an additional 1m higher in the next century, but the number just keep increasing. Low-lying countries like Singapore will be highly affected and soon other countries as well.</p>
<p>This is what we could and should do to tackle this "war" together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce your use of plastic. Instead, use recycables. Use your own cups instead of plastic ones. Use reusable shopping bags instead og plastic bags offered as stores.</li>
<li>Instead of using cars as a means of travel. Perhaps, you could use public transport or walk or cycle.</li>
<li>Practice the 4Rs. Reduce, reuse, recycle and refuse. Reduce your waste. Reuse plastic or paper. Recycle recycables (remember to wash bottles, cans and plastic before putting them into the recycling bin to prevent contamination). Refuse any unnecessary products like pastic bags.
</ol>
<p>We are all humans on this planet call "Earth". However, if we don't do our part to save this place we call our home. I am afraid that we might not have a home soon.</p>
<p>I hate to say this but, the Earth is certainly dying due to climate change. It is dying fast. Furthermore, it is our fault that climate change even occured. It is said that 60% of Singapore's carbon emmissions come from industries. So, what right do we have to say that this was not our doing?</p>
<p>Even our Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Long has raised a clarion call to ask all citizens to do our part to fight against climate change. This issue is certainly worrisome and it not only affects us but animals all around the world. Due to climate change, many species have gone extinct or became endangered due the loss of their habitats.</p>
<p>Just in the beginning of this year, 2020, there was a long period of Australia wildfires that alarmed people all over the globe to take action. People in Australia could be seen feeding water to the poor Koalas that have, unfortunately, lost their homes to the wildfire.</p>

<p>This may seem horrible but more is yet to come.</p>
<p>Do your part NOW and spread awareness!</p>
